      "Hi, my name is Mounica. My role at JP Morgan Chase is Associate Software Engineer. I get to develop new applications and support and maintain existing applications as well. We constantly work on improving our infrastructure to deliver the best value to the customers. I really love the programs and initiatives JP Morgan Chase has for its employees, which constantly empower them to come up with the most innovative solutions. Every piece of code I write. Every second, every minute, I invest in exploring new technology has a direct impact on the business. I was working on the Paycheck Protection Program, which was introduced, especially during the times of COVID in the United States. We, as part of JP Morgan Chase, are responsible to release the funds to the small business customers so that they could give salaries to their employees. I have got an opportunity to mentor college graduates. I have constantly encouraged them to brainstorm and come up with new ideas and innovative solutions. Once I have been transformed into a corporate professional, my next step is to transform into a good leader. Gardening really gives me a lot of peace. As soon as I enter into my garden it really feels exciting for me to nurture the plants, seeing them grow. If you look at gardening, we take a lot of care, and we really enjoy seeing them grow.\n",
